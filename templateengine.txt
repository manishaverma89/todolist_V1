Using template engines with Express

app.set('view engine', 'ejs');

A template engine enables you to use static template files in your application. At runtime, the template engine replaces variables in a template file with actual values, and transforms the template into an HTML file sent to the client. This approach makes it easier to design an HTML page.

Some popular template engines that work with Express are Pug, Mustache, and EJS


app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
> This line of code tells our app which is generated using express to use ejs as its "view engine".
Its important to place this line of code below  this line like:
const app = express();
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');

> res.render() method uses the "view engine" to render a particular page
> create a "views" directory containing a "list.ejs" page
> Anything that is valid html is a valid ejs file

>>we need to be able to essentially pass the information from app.js file, where all of the logic and the code gets executed.  And take the result of thet logic to place it in list.ejs file. 

>>  <%= Outputs the value into the template (HTML escaped)
